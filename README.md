# Modelling-of-climate
## Differential Equations project

This project deals with climate models and their construction. In
particular, it talks about the construction of climate models using
differential equations. The project begins with an explanation of what a
climate model is, and what must be considered when making one.
Following that, some climate models have been discussed. The EBM
and an added adjustment (The Latitude dependent model) have been
talked about, with a description of how they are made. Following that,
the project details the use of the Lotka-Volterra prey-predator model to
describe the interplay of temperature and relative humidity in a
particular region. Two more models have been described very briefly,
ended by the components of a climate model and the ways in which it
is validated.
